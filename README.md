## Synopsis

This mobile game utilizes Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework in order to connect 2-8 devices and play a round of telephone-pictionary. The MPC framework allows devices to communicate locally over Wi-Fi or bluetooth, which allows the game to be an in-person social experience for users. On the app store today!

## Development

This app was the product of 3 weeks of work between Ernie Barojas, Lance Russ, and Caleb Talbot during a Mobile Makers Academy cohort. Mobile Makers Academy was an 8-week advanced software engineering intensive which covers Objective C, Swift, and several of Appleâ€™s fundamental frameworks to develop over 30 small apps.
